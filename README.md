# Computer Vision Rock-Paper-Scissors

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock. The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins.
In this project, I created an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera. Firstly trained a computer vision model using Teachable-Machine.The model detects whether the user shows Rock, Paper, Scissors to the camera, so that the user can leverage that. Using Object Orientated Programming, I created my RPS class and created a Python script where the user inputs their choice, whilst the computer randomly picks an option between rock, paper, or scissors. I finally amended my Python script to apply the programming logic using the Tensorflow API and OpenCV so that the user can play with the computer using the camera. The first to three wins is the winner.

 Python libraries used: keras, tensorflow, cv2, numpy
 
 Other software used: Teachable Machine
